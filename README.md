# whatcard

Here lies the remains of a multiplayer, mobile, card-based game I was developing. I still think it's a cool idea, but I am too busy with real job + other side projects to continue.

Also used this as an opportunity to try out Flutter. If I were to start on this again, I would probably use Expo/React
